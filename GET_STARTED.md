# Get Started in 3 Steps

Choose your path based on your needs:

## Path 1: Try It Now (5 minutes)

**Perfect for**: Testing the application locally before connecting to real databases.

```bash
# 1. Start test databases and setup replication
make docker-demo

# 2. In a new terminal, start the monitor
make run-docker

# 3. Open your browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

**What you'll see:**
- 2 databases (source and target)
- 1 publication with test data
- 1 active replication slot
- Real-time LSN tracking
- Live replication statistics

**Test replication:**
```bash
make docker-test
```

Watch the dashboard update in real-time as data replicates!

---

## Path 2: Monitor Your RDS Migration (10 minutes)

**Perfect for**: Actual database encryption migration.

### Step 1: Configure Your Databases

```bash
cp config.yaml config.yaml.local
nano config.yaml.local
```

Update with your RDS endpoints:
```yaml
databases:
  - name: "source-db"
    host: "your-source.region.rds.amazonaws.com"
    port: 5432
    user: "postgres"
    password: "your-password"
    dbname: "postgres"
    role: "source"
    
  - name: "target-db"
    host: "your-target.region.rds.amazonaws.com"
    port: 5432
    user: "postgres"
    password: "your-password"
    dbname: "postgres"
    role: "target"
```

### Step 2: Build and Run

```bash
# Download dependencies
make deps

# Build the application
make build

# Run the monitor
./bin/monitor -config config.yaml.local
```

### Step 3: Access Dashboard

```
http://localhost:8080
```

**Before you start replication, you should see:**
- âœ… Both databases connected
- Publications on source (if created)
- Replication slots on source (if created)
- No subscriptions on target yet

**After setting up replication:**
- âœ… Active replication slots
- âœ… Enabled subscriptions
- ðŸ“Š LSN distance decreasing
- ðŸ’š Healthy status when caught up

---

## Path 3: Production Deployment (30 minutes)

**Perfect for**: Running the monitor on EC2/ECS during migration.

### Quick Deploy to EC2

```bash
# 1. SSH to your EC2 instance
ssh ec2-user@your-instance

# 2. Install Go
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/go/bin

# 3. Clone and build
git clone <your-repo> /opt/monitoring-replication
cd /opt/monitoring-replication
make build

# 4. Configure
sudo mkdir -p /etc/monitoring-replication
sudo cp config.yaml /etc/monitoring-replication/config.yaml
sudo nano /etc/monitoring-replication/config.yaml

# 5. Run
./bin/monitor -config /etc/monitoring-replication/config.yaml
```

For systemd service setup, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## What to Monitor

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | Target Value |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **LSN Distance** | How far behind target is from source | 0 bytes = ready for cutover |
| **Replication Lag** | Time delay in seconds | < 1 second = healthy |
| **Slot Status** | Is replication active? | Active = good |
| **Health Status** | Overall system health | Healthy = ready |

### Dashboard Sections

1. **Summary Cards** (top)
   - Total publications, subscriptions, slots
   - Maximum lag across all databases

2. **Health Status**
   - Overall health indicator
   - List of issues (if any)

3. **Database Details** (per database)
   - Publications and tables (source)
   - Replication slots and stats (source)
   - Subscriptions (target)
   - Subscription statistics (target)

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Test Locally First

```bash
# 1. Test with Docker
make docker-demo
make run-docker

# 2. Verify everything works
make docker-test

# 3. Stop Docker
make docker-down

# 4. Configure for real databases
cp config.yaml config.yaml.local
nano config.yaml.local

# 5. Run against real databases
make run-local
```

### Workflow 2: Monitor Existing Replication

If you already have replication set up:

```bash
# 1. Configure databases
nano config.yaml

# 2. Run monitor
make run

# 3. Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

You should immediately see your existing publications, subscriptions, and replication status.

### Workflow 3: Complete Migration

```bash
# 1. Start monitor BEFORE creating subscriptions
make run-local

# 2. In PostgreSQL, create publications on source
# (see MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md)

# 3. Take snapshot and restore to encrypted instance

# 4. Create subscriptions on target
# (see MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md)

# 5. Watch dashboard until LSN distance = 0

# 6. Perform cutover when ready
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to database?

```bash
# Test connection manually
psql -h your-db.region.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -d postgres

# Check security groups allow your IP
# Verify credentials are correct
```

### Dashboard shows "Disconnected"?

- Check database endpoints in config
- Verify network connectivity
- Check PostgreSQL logs for connection errors

### No replication data showing?

```sql
-- On source, verify publications exist
SELECT * FROM pg_publication;

-- On source, verify slots exist
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

-- On target, verify subscriptions exist
SELECT * FROM pg_subscription;
```

### Build errors?

```bash
# Update dependencies
make deps

# Try building again
make build
```

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

âœ… Dashboard shows "Connected" for all databases  
âœ… Publications appear on source database  
âœ… Replication slots show as "Active"  
âœ… LSN distance decreases over time  
âœ… Health status shows "Healthy"  
âœ… Data inserted on source appears on target  

**When LSN distance = 0 bytes, you're ready for cutover!**
